The contour_challenge data was submitted by a user in industry. 
These are the exact file sent. 
Due to many repeated values in the data it was best to manipulate it into 
a time-event-qty dataframe. This was a good test for R useage on its own.

When attempting the likelihood ratio bounds it was found that the contour
preparation was particularly challenging. This led to revision of the code
seeking the radial distance from mle point in a divide and seek method rather
than the original quasi-Newton secant method. Upon reaching a "stable contour"
code it was resolved to submit WeibullR to CRAN for the first time.
