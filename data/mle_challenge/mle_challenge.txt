This mle_challenge dataset was submitted by a user, who discovered that
the original WeibullR CRAN submission would crash upon attempted 
2-parameter Weibull fitting.

This user was studying low failure rate engine parts. This was
one of several datasets that exposed this bug. 

Several validating runs on other software revealed that this fit
should be accomplished. But the most compelling reason for debug 
was the hard crash that would ensue.

Protective code was first added resulting in graceful termination 
of attempted fitting with negative parameters.
The real cause of negative parameter generation turned out to be
resolved by running the Nelder-Mead, simplex optimization using 
the log of eta. It turns out that this is widely used by others 
using parameters mu [as log(eta)] and sigma [as 1/beta].
